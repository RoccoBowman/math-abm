# math-abm
Contains replication code for an ABM-like simulation describing proof-generation in mathematics. This is code provided in a consultation role and represents a proof-of-concept rather than the end product of the research. 

In short, the code simulates a mathematician attempting to solve a mathematical proof and creating inscriptions while they work. The movement of attention is key here, and the network connections between inscriptions are, theoretically, crucial for solving the proof where rare connections lead to insights.
